# compiler
Implementation of a compiler (lexer, parser, generator)

## Language syntax

The following code

```
add_and_multiply x y =>
  (multiply 10 (add x y))
e
```

defines a new function that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and first adds their values and then multiplies the result by `10`. Finally, it returns the result.

The compiled Javascript is

```
function add_and_multiply(x, y) {
 return multiply(10, add(x, y));
}
```

## Target language

At the moment the target language is Javascript, but once the tree has been generated by the parser, a new code generator can be implemented for a different target. See `generator.py`.
